Hi ██ Robinson
As you are aware, your business unit has been selected to participate in
███████ ███ (██████ █████ █████████) for the rollout of Windows 2000.  In
preparation for this rollout, it is imperative that we gather information
about your workstation and the applications you use.  To begin this data
collection, we have automated the process.  In fact, your system has just
been inventoried.   Once this information is received, we will be working
with your local department coordinator to consolidate this information to
ensure this transition is as smooth as possible.

The ███ team would like to thank you for your participation.  If you have any
questions, please contact █████ ██████ █████████████.
█████████████
address is 123 Ave Norman Oklahoma 73072
